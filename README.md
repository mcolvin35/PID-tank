## **Planning**
### **Brainstorming**
My original idea for this project was to make a tank that followed an object forwards and backwards with PID. I ended up making it turn to follow an object as well, but honestly, I wanted to do the double sensor design because I thought it would look cool, and then I decided to use both sensors to detect objects from the side after that.

Here's the original sketch for my design!

And here's a "more refined" version I made later
